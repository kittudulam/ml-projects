Description

The Framingham dataset contains longitudinal health information collected as part of the Framingham Heart Study. It includes demographic details, lifestyle factors, clinical measurements, and cardiovascular outcomes.

For this project, a subset of attributes is used for the Basic risk model, focusing on features that are commonly available without advanced laboratory or imaging tests.

Key Attributes Used (Basic Model)

•	male: Sex (1 = Male, 0 = Female)

•	age: Age in years

•	sysBP: Systolic blood pressure (mmHg)

•	currentSmoker: Smoking status (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

•	diabetes: Diabetes status (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

•	BMI: Body Mass Index

•	TenYearCHD: 10-year coronary heart disease outcome (target variable)

Notes

•	Missing values are handled using median imputation within the ML pipeline.

•	The dataset represents a specific population and time period; results may not generalize to all populations.

Ethical Consideration

This dataset is publicly released for research and educational purposes. No personally identifiable information is included.
